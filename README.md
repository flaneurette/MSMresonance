Acoustics physical modeling - Calculate mass-spring resonance of gypsum and rockwool

This HTML/JavaScript calculator calculates the resonant freqency of an air cavity between two leafs (walls). It takes the width of a leaf, it's mass and widt and gives back the resonant frequency. 

It can be used to calculate the required air cavity and thickness of walls to obtain adequate soundproofing in a room.
